	SELLING VIA EMAIL

The listicle email template:

identify the niche and specific product
every point needs to have reasons
emotions
alegories

but all of this is useless without this:
more reasons...

soft call to action

what is this?
why should I keep reading?
what should I do next?


get attention:
challenge their beliefs
ask a 2 option question
be relatable
ask a paradoxical question
strong promise

problem-solution loop

give the solution at the end of the email and tell that that solution will come up with a new problem that can be fixed hitting the link

WIREFRAMING:

This portion of the project consists of an initial sketch of where items will be placed on the various template pages.
Templates for pages such as the blog, team, sidebar, full width and others will be sketched out.
